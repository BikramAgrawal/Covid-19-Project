# COVID-19 Trend Analysis and Prediction Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 trends and predicting future cases using Python. The goal is to process real-world COVID-19 data, visualize key insights, and make short-term predictions to aid in understanding the progression of the pandemic.

## Problem Statement

Given CSV datasets containing information on confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, the objective is to:

 1. Analyze trends in infection, recovery, and fatality rates.

 2. Visualize the data using interactive plots.

 3.  Build a time series forecasting model to predict the number of future cases.

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas: For data cleaning and preprocessing.

Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.

Facebook Prophet: For building time series forecasting models.

CSV: Data source format.

Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files containing daily reports of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide and regionally.

Project Steps

Data Collection

Loaded CSV files containing COVID-19 data.

Merged and cleaned the data using Pandas.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and ensured consistency across datasets.

Filtered data to focus on specific regions (e.g., India and global data).

Data Visualization

Created interactive plots using Plotly to show trends in:

Daily and cumulative confirmed cases.

Daily recoveries and deaths.

Recovery and fatality rates.

Time Series Forecasting

Built forecasting models using Facebook Prophet.

Predicted the number of new cases for the following week.

Visualized the forecasted results alongside historical data.

Insights and Results

Provided insights on the progression of the pandemic based on visualizations.

Generated short-term forecasts to help understand potential future trends.

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository.

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas plotly prophet

Run the main Python script:

python covid19_analysis.py

View the generated visualizations and predictions.

Future Scope

Extend the project to include vaccination data for more comprehensive analysis.

Incorporate additional machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.

Automate data collection from online sources for real-time analysis.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Python for real-world data analysis and forecasting. It provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making during such critical times.
